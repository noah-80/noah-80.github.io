            LA Waterkeeper requested designs that allowed users to learn about LA River issues and explore LA River project case studies through a map.
<br><br>
In January, I created initial lo-fi wireframes visualizing the information in one interface to pitch to Waterkeeper.
<br><br>
At first, I desgined an open, exploratory page. This would allow for users to learn about LA River issues and project case studies on their own accord.
<br><br>

        <img id="wkcasestudypic" src="../images/Feb.webp"><br><br>
        <div class="casestudytext">
            By February, the map page‚Äôs interface was divided into three different tabs to differentiate between LA River issues, projects, and future prospects. Rather than attempting to visualize all three topics at once, each sub-page on the map was separated.
        </div><br>
        <img id="wkcasestudypic" src="../images/Feedback.webp"><br><br>
        <div class="casestudytext">
            After review with Waterkeeper, we decided that the use of buttons/filtering created too many options for navigation. Additionally, the design was reliant on text to educate, rather than leveraging graphics. Waterkeeper sought more streamlined navigation and guidance for readers as they progressed through the site to learn about the LA River.
        </div>

        <img id="wkcasestudypic" src="../images/Header.webp"><br><br>
        <img id="wkcasestudypic" src="../images/OrderedSlide.webp"><br><br>
        <div class="casestudytext">
            In March and April, the entire site structure had been changed to a continuous scrolling, sequential site between all sections. With this, I redesigned the header to include a progress bar, while still keeping buttons for users to jump between sections.
<br><br>
For the map page, we decided to have ordered slides for the LA River issues and case studies instead of a choose-your-own-adventure style navigation. This would provide users with a more guided educational module. I worked on ideating potential interfaces for ordered slides and more visual storytelling.
<br><br>        
</div>
        <img id="wkcasestudypic" src="../images/Scrolling.webp"><br><br>
        <div class="casestudytext">
            During a client meeting with Waterkeeper, despite the continuous storytelling, we received feedback that progressing through LA River issues through click/keypad still wasn‚Äôt intuitive enough for users.
<br><br>
During this meeting, I mocked up and pitched a vertical scrolling progress bar within the LA River issues page. Rather than having to click/press arrows through each ordered section, one would simply need to scroll. This would match the vertical scrolling navigation throughout the entire site. This vertical scrolling progress bar was later implemented into the final site design.
<br><br>        
</div>
        <img id="wkcasestudypic" src="../images/Map.webp"><br><br>
        <div class="casestudytext">
A vertical scrolling progress bar was also pitched for the LA River project case studies section. The case studies would be ordered north to south. However, Waterkeeper requested a break from the streamlined navigation for users to be able to freely choose between case studies on the project map.
<br><br>
I jotted down these questions with the free-for-all design request for the map:
<ul>
    <li>How do we ensure that users know to visit a project case study instead of skipping it over?</li>
    <li>How will a user know when to exit out of the map page? If the rest of the site uses a vertical scroll, what is the interaction to exit the map (a vertical scroll, exit button, etc.)?</li>
</ul><br>



        </div>
        <img id="wkcasestudypic" src="../images/FinalMap.webp"><br><br>
        <div class="casestudytext">
            To ensure users knew to visit a project, I designed a final map with pins (üìç), rather highlighted regions of varying size. Additionally, guidance to click a pin to view a project was written in text.
        <br><br>
        An exit button was implemented, preventing users from scrolling away from the map accidentally.
